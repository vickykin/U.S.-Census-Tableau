# U.S.-Census-Tableau
## Dataset
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the census data for all counties in 2015 with 119,174 rows. The objective is to three visualizations to reveal insights from the data. Two areas that I was most interested in exploring is population demographics and jobs. Specifically, I was curious to see:
1. Is there a correlation between the poverty rate and the percentage of the population that works in the professional industry?
2. What is the distribution of the Asian American population in the U.S.?
3. What does the job distribution look like by state and county?

## Summary of Findings
1. To answer question number one, I used a scatter plot and discovered that there is a negative correlation between the poverty rate and the percentage of professionals in a state. The higher the poverty rate, the lower the percentage of professionals there is in a state. 
2. Using a horizontal bar graph with the ability to gain more insights when hoverying over each bar, the top states with the highest Asian American population are Hawaii (36.75%), California (13.52%), New Jersey (9%), New York (7.92%), and Washington (7.6%).
3. With the stacked bars to show the proportion different job categories and a map with the ability to specify by state and county, the dashboard allows for a quick visual and reference to which types and where the jobs are in the country.
